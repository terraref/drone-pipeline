    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial covers how to use Python to send a request to Clowder to start processing a set of previously loaded drone data.\n",
    "Completing this tutorial will provide the background for submitting other extractor requests and determining if the requests are successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Audience\n",
    "This tutorial is geared towards people that are familiar with Jupyter Notebooks and prefer working in that environment.\n",
    "It will also be helpful, but not required, to have a background in Python.\n",
    "This notebook might also be of interest if you have a background in Python and are learning Jupyter.\n",

    "## What to expect <a name=\"expect\"></a>\n",
    "We will be using a Python library to do most of the work for us.\n",
    "Each step of this tutorial contains text describing what needs to be done and then presents code that performs those actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites <a name=\"prerequisites\"></a>\n",
    "To successfully complete this tutorial you will need to have an existing Clowder account and have data loaded into a dataset.\n",
    "Additionally, the Python `pipelineutils` library will need to have been installed on the Jupyter Notebook instance this tutorial is running on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cautions <a name=\"cautions\"></a>\n",
    "There are two main files in the Clowder dataset to be processed that, if they are in the dataset, will be overwritten.\n",
    "These files are the *experiment.yaml* file and the *extractors-opendronemap.txt* file.\n",
    "If you have placed these files in the dataset this tutorial will process, you should download them to preserve them."
