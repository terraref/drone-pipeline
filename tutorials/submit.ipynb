    "This notebook is for people that want to learn how to process drone data using the Clowder-based Drone Pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's helpful, but not necessary, to be familiar with Jupyter Notebooks and, perhaps, have some experience with Python.\n",

    "## What to expect <a name=\"expect\"></a>\n",
    "We will be using a Python library to do most of the work for us.\n",
    "Each step of this tutorial contains text describing what needs to be done and then presents code that performs those actions.\n",

    ">Perform the following steps to install the `pipelineutils` library:\n",
